## Description
The **o1 at home** pipe is a Manifold pipe designed to process user queries using a two-step process:
1. **Thinking Step:** Generates internal reasoning based on the query.
2. **Responding Step:** Produces a final response using the reasoning.

This pipe is lightweight and doesn't require an additional pipeline server to run.
